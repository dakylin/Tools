1. MySQL Server IP: 192.168.75.130
2. The server config should allow remote access
3. Set the env in .bash_profile for MySQL lib
	Here is the sample in my RH VM:
export MYSQL_HOME=/daniel/mysql
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MYSQL_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin
export PATH

4. In the Makefile, MYSQL_HOME is set to build
	In the .bash_profile, MYSQL_HOME is set to run

5. The machine which used to run the sample does not need to install MySQL, but it does need the libs
